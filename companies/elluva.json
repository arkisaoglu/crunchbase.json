Our consumer users will, in turn, have instant access to exclusive promotions that connect with their interests and past behavior, and are relevant to their current and/or specified locations.</p>\n\n<p>We will provide this service for our consumer and business users at no charge and be compensated only when a deal is redeemed at the point of sale. We believe this creates a unique ethos and focus for our intermediary business: elluva’s success is linked to everyone in the business chain benefiting, rather than value being derived from our ability to squeeze supplier costs or exploit consumer margins.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0019/9065/199065v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0019/9065/199065v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0019/9065/199065v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"iOS App","permalink":"ios-app","image":null},{"name":"Merchant Services Web Interface","permalink":"merchant-services-web-interface","image":null}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Sok","permalink":"alex-sok-2","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder/EVP Merchant Operations","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Keeney","permalink":"ben-keeney","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director of Business Development","person":{"first_name":"Nahid","last_name":"Fattahi","permalink":"nahid-fattahi","image":null}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[{"title":"Legal","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman","permalink":"pillsbury-winthrop-shaw-pittman","image":null}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.elluva.com","title":"website"}]}
