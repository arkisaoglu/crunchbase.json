With deployments worldwide, Cartasite has improved safety, enhanced security, and ensured effective utilization of critical assets for some of the largest corporations.  Our focus has been the global energy industry whose workers and equipment are placed into some of the harshest conditions on the planet.  Weâ€™ve learned a lot about the realities on faraway places, hostile environments, and the safety of people.  It has prepared us well for our newest adventure.  Making safer streets!  We believe ROVER will change the way people think about driving, and we are committed to bringing this lifesaving technology to people everywhere.  </p>\n\n<p>Cartasiteâ€™s executive team has a strong track record in the energy technology business, and the software, systems, and services it delivers are setting new standards of operation and producing substantial bottom line results for its customers.  David Armitage, founder and CEO, is renown for introducing game-changing solutions to the geospatial industry, applying new technology to create practical, affordable, and accessible solutions.  GeoGraphix, his first company, was one of the first and largest Windows based applications ever developed, and is still the leading desktop GIS system used worldwide by geoscientists.</p>\n\n<p>Cartasite has optimized the data processing, visualization, and deployment of wireless telemetry systems to accommodate the unique demands of the global energy industry and currently operates both domestically and internationally monitoring thousands of critical assets and locations.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO / Founder","person":{"first_name":"David","last_name":"Armitage","permalink":"david-armitage","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP - Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Mason","permalink":"mark-mason","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP - Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Gregory","last_name":"Kushnir","permalink":"gregory-kushnir","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Controller","person":{"first_name":"Donna","last_name":"Hardin","permalink":"donna-hardin","image":null}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Director Sales/Marketing","person":{"first_name":"Lynelle","last_name":"Bautista","permalink":"lynelle-bautista","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"GreenRoad Technologies ","permalink":"greenroad-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,37],"assets/images/resized/0002/2646/22646v3-max-150x150.png"],[[250,62],"assets/images/resized/0002/2646/22646v3-max-250x250.png"],[[450,112],"assets/images/resized/0002/2646/22646v3-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Turnpike Global Technologies","permalink":"turnpike-global-technologies","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,83],"assets/images/resized/0006/8605/68605v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,139],"assets/images/resized/0006/8605/68605v1-max-250x250.png"],[[450,251],"assets/images/resized/0006/8605/68605v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"GeoDecisions","permalink":"geodecisions","image":{"available_sizes":[[[129,75],"assets/images/resized/0005/0718/50718v1-max-150x150.png"],[[129,75],"assets/images/resized/0005/0718/50718v1-max-250x250.png"],[[129,75],"assets/images/resized/0005/0718/50718v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$5.7M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":1200000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2004,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]},{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.thealarmclock.com/mt/archives/2007/03/post_259.html","source_description":"","raised_amount":4500000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":30,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Acadia Woods Partners","permalink":"acadia-woods-partners","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Canterbury Partners","permalink":"canterbury-partners","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"1123 Auraria Parkway","address2":"Suite 100","zip_code":"80204","city":"Denver","state_code":"CO","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
