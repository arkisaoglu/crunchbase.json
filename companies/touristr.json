The concept was for people to find and share travel spots around the world. In June 2007, TouristR beta was released at Reboot, Copenhagen.  The following 6 months, the website recorded +2M visits and our community added +3,000 documented travel spots in 86 countries.</p>\n\n<p>2008/10 saw a desire to provide planning and booking tools to the community of users.  A strategic partnership with DERI allowed the start up to research and build a semantic Trip Planner integrating worldwide providers of transport, accommodation and activities to offer the ultimate planning experience. The start up started to aggregate content from various sources and made the search seamless for million of data.</p>\n\n<p>TouristR is taking a break since Sept 2010 as the team behind the website is looking at taking a fresh perspective on travel planning.</p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"€500k","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"seed","source_url":"","source_description":"","raised_amount":500000,"raised_currency_code":"EUR","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":null,"funded_day":null,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
