RelayRides connects people who need a car with vehicle owners whose rides would otherwise be sitting idle. Car owners set the price and availability, and RelayRides provides the technology infrastructure and a $1M insurance policy to make the transaction safe and convenient. </p>\n\n<p>Riding the building wave of collaborative consumption businesses such as Airbnb, Rent the Runway, and Netflix, RelayRides is reinventing mobility and is on a mission to fundamentally change the paradigm of car ownership. Along the way, RelayRides is tackling a multi-billion dollar economic opportunity, greening cities by making it easier to live without a car, invigorating local economies, and building stronger communities. </p>\n\n<p>In October 2011, RelayRides announced a major strategic partnership with automotive giant, GM. 15M eligible GM car owners can link their cars&#8217; OnStar subscription to their RelayRides account, making it possible for borrowers to unlock a reserved car through OnStar with nothing more than a mobile phone, eliminating the need to meet the owner to exchange keys or install an access device in the car. While a handful of auto manufacturers have made a play in car sharing, the GM partnership represents the largest move into car sharing by an auto manufacturer to date. </p>\n\n<p>RelayRides is headquartered in San Francisco, CA and has raised $13MM from tier-one investors, including August Capital, Shasta Ventures, Google Ventures, and General Motors Ventures.
