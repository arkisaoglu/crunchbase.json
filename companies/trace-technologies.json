In addition, optic fibre reduces aircraft weight so improving fuel economy and increases the aircraft&#8217;s range.</p>\n\n<p>While both commercial and military aerospace manufacturers are keen to embrace the benefits of fibre optic cabling, the harsh working environment demands a high standard of system design. Designers need reliable tools to enable them to create harnesses that work first time, every time.</p>\n\n<p>Trace Technologies provides the solution with PISDâ„¢ - the first dedicated practical engineering tool that means aerospace system engineers can easily design, install, test and build reliable fibre optic cable harnesses for next generation systems on today&#8217;s aircraft.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[154,94],"assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[154,94],"assets/images/resized/0008/5350/85350v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.18M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"","source_description":"Cap Funding Report","raised_amount":1180000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":27,"investments":[{"company":{"name":"Xenos","permalink":"xenos","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,50],"assets/images/resized/0006/8947/68947v1-max-150x150.png"],[[175,59],"assets/images/resized/0006/8947/68947v1-max-250x250.png"],[[175,59],"assets/images/resized/0006/8947/68947v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"financial_org":null,"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"HSBC  Principal Investments","permalink":"hsbc-principal-investments","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,21],"assets/images/resized/0006/1394/61394v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,35],"assets/images/resized/0006/1394/61394v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[279,40],"assets/images/resized/0006/1394/61394v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Welsh Assembly Government","permalink":"welsh-assembly-government","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,31],"assets/images/resized/0002/9705/29705v1-max-150x150.png"],[[250,51],"assets/images/resized/0002/9705/29705v1-max-250x250.png"],[[329,68],"assets/images/resized/0002/9705/29705v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Finance Wales Investments","permalink":"finance-wales-investments","image":null},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,118],"assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,198],"assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,356],"assets/images/resized/0008/5351/85351v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
