And we believe there must be a better solution for dog owners when they are away than paying to lock their dog in a cage or constantly imposing on friends and family. At Rover.com, our mission is to allow dog owners to easily tap into the 40 million U.S. dog-owning households as well as a myriad of other pet lovers-including professionals - to meet their dog care needs. Our approach will greatly increase the number of high quality, local, and affordable options for dog owners.</p>\n\n<p>Seattle&#8217;s first dedicated matchmaking service for dog care providers and dog owners, Rover.com officially launched in November 2011.
