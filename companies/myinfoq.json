In addition to tagging anything in the real world, myinfoQ is also a simple web publishing platform, allowing user generated SMS codes for self distribution of information in areas such as real estate, small business, events, music and more.</p>\n\n<p>myinfoQ is a mobileâ€“originated experience that ends on the web. To start, users simply text or use an iPhone applet to send content to myinfoQ.  An account is autoâ€“created and sent back to the user.  Users can then continue their myinfoQ experience on the web, where initial tags are populated with meaningful search results, calendaring and more.</p>\n\n<p>myinfoQâ€™s aim is to tag your everyday interests so you donâ€™t forget a thing! Founded in 2008, myinfoQ is a privately funded startup based in Australia.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,91],"assets/images/resized/0005/9635/59635v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0005/9635/59635v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,153],"assets/images/resized/0005/9635/59635v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Dugald","last_name":"Holmes","permalink":"dugald-holmes","image":{"available_sizes":[[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/9715/59715v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/9715/59715v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[115,150],"assets/images/resized/0005/9715/59715v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":""}}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Engineer","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Phan","permalink":"daniel-phan","image":null}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Voulas","permalink":"paul-voulas","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Posterous","permalink":"posterous","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0002/1222/21222v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0002/1222/21222v7-max-250x250.png"],[[288,95],"assets/images/resized/0002/1222/21222v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}},{"competitor":{"name":"Plum","permalink":"plum","image":{"available_sizes":[[[127,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/7265/27265v1-max-150x150.png"],[[127,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/7265/27265v1-max-250x250.png"],[[127,46],"assets/images/resized/0002/7265/27265v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Sydney","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null},{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"","city":"Canberra","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
