Brands offer up their most challenging briefs to a community of creative idea generators for a specified bounty. The best idea gets paid. Idea Bounty sets its self apart from other crowdsourcing platforms by only asking for ideas and not finished or completed work in answer to briefs posted by clients. </p>\n\n<p>A client posts a brief with a reward (Bounty) for the best solution to a marketing or communication problem on Idea Bounty. Instead of 2 or 3 creatives thinking about a clients problem and being charged per hour, the clients offers a once off incentive and contributions can grow exponentially while the cost remains the same. The best idea wins the &#8216;Bounty&#8217; or reward. The whole process is protected by a robust legal framework and supported by a set of services to help the client get the most out of a brief.</p>\n\n<p>Idea Bounty has more than 20,000 registered community members and has worked with brands including FNB, The World Wildlife Fund, Unilever, Chevrolet, The Financial Times and South African Breweries. </p>","image":null,"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Operations Manager & Captain","person":{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Neville","permalink":"daniel-neville","image":null}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"BootB","permalink":"bootb","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0002/0424/20424v4-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0002/0424/20424v4-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,450],"assets/images/resized/0002/0424/20424v4-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":{"price_amount":null,"price_currency_code":"USD","term_code":"cash_and_stock","source_url":"","source_description":"","acquired_year":2012,"acquired_month":5,"acquired_day":14,"acquiring_company":{"name":"42Engines","permalink":"42engines","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,106],"assets/images/resized/0022/1312/221312v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,176],"assets/images/resized/0022/1312/221312v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[400,283],"assets/images/resized/0022/1312/221312v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}}},"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Head Office","address1":"3rd Floor, Block C ","address2":"cnr Searle & Pontac Street  ","zip_code":"7925","city":"Cape Town","state_code":null,"country_code":"ZAF","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[]}
