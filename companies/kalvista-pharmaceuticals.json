KalVista is developing novel plasma kallikrein inhibitors, which represents a new approach to the treatment of DME, a leading cause of adult visual loss in developed countries. KalVista has an advanced pre-clinical product pipeline resulting from over 20 years of leading pharmaceutical discovery in the field of serine protease inhibitors and is targeting both intravitreal injection and oral administration. Although VEGF inhibitors clearly can benefit DME, a significant number of patients do not respond fully to these agents and have limited treatment options. Plasma kallikrein inhibitors target a distinct molecular pathway and as such have the potential to offer those patients an effective treatment option.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,132],"assets/images/resized/0015/0686/150686v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[187,165],"assets/images/resized/0015/0686/150686v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[187,165],"assets/images/resized/0015/0686/150686v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"£8M","funding_rounds":[{"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kalvista-pharmaceuticals-launched-with-8-million-in-series-a-funding-to-develop-novel-class-of-drugs-for-diabetic-macular-edema-128230123.html","source_description":"KalVista Pharmaceuticals Launched With Â£8 Million in Series A Funding to Develop Novel Class of Drugs for Diabetic Macular Edema","raised_amount":8000000,"raised_currency_code":"GBP","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":8,"funded_day":23,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Novo A/S","permalink":"novo-a-s","image":null},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"SV Life Sciences","permalink":"sv-life-sciences","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,70],"assets/images/resized/0004/5361/45361v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,117],"assets/images/resized/0004/5361/45361v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[267,125],"assets/images/resized/0004/5361/45361v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1 Venture Road","address2":"Southampton Science Park","zip_code":"SO16 7NP","city":"Southampton","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,116],"assets/images/resized/0015/0687/150687v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,193],"assets/images/resized/0015/0687/150687v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,348],"assets/images/resized/0015/0687/150687v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[]}
