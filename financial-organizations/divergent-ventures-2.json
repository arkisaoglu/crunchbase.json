Our preferred initial investment point is in the first professional round. We will consider seed stage investments and we reserve capital for participating in follow on rounds.</p>\n\n<p>THEMES\nInfrastructure, Communications, Software, Services: We have over 30 years of experience building products and services and investing in companies that provide the technical building blocks that todayâ€™s networks and information systems are built upon.</p>\n\n<p>GEOGRAPHY\nEarly Stage investing is well served by being accessible and available. We have found that time zones make it much more difficult to deliver on the promise of close involvement. We have successfully invested across the country, but are focusing our current efforts on the west coast. </p>\n\n<p>The Managing Directors are Kevin Ober and Rob Shurtleff, both highly experienced and successful early-stage investors. The firm invests in early-stage companies, with an emphasis on software, internet infrastructure and information technology enabled services.</p>\n\n<p>Our experience has taught us the importance of being closely involved with the companies we invest in, partnering with management to help overcome the many challenges faced by early-stage companies.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to investment capital, we actively work with our portfolio company management teams and potitial investment management teams to refine their plans, introduce them to potential customers, employees and investors.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[134,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0781/20781v3-max-150x150.jpg"],[[134,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0781/20781v3-max-250x250.jpg"],[[134,57],"assets/images/resized/0002/0781/20781v3-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"1652
